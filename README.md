AutomationExercise Selenium

This repository contains UI test automation examples for the AutomationExercise demo website, built using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and PyTest, following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
The project is created for learning and practicing test automation, covering common end-to-end user flows such as user registration, login, account management, and account deletion.

The main goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate core automation testing concepts, including:

Page Object Model (POM)
Test structure and execution with PyTest
Dynamic test data generation (e.g. unique email addresses)
Assertions and basic UI validations
Clean, readable, and reusable test code

This framework serves as a hands-on practice project and is ideal for beginners and junior automation engineers who want to strengthen their Selenium skills and understand how to build maintainable UI test automation frameworks.
