AutomationExercise Selenium
Automated UI tests built with Python + Selenium + PyTest using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern.
Project is created for practice and learning test automation, covering common user flows like signup, login, and account management on automationexercise.com.

This repository contains UI test automation examples for the AutomationExercise demo website, implemented using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and PyTest.
The goal of this project is to practice automation testing concepts, including:

Page Object Model (POM)
Test structure with PyTest
Dynamic test data (e.g. unique emails)
Assertions and basic validations
Clean and reusable test code


This project is a learning and practice automation framework built on top of the AutomationExercise demo site.
It demonstrates:
Selenium WebDriver usage with Python
Page Object Model architecture
Writing maintainable and readable automated tests
End-to-end scenarios such as user registration, login, and account deletion
Ideal for beginners and junior automation engineers who want hands-on Selenium practice.
